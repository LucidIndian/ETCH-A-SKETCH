# ETCH-A-SKETCH
ETCH-A-SKETCH project - The Odin Project - Foundations
I will eventually complete this project and it will be good enough to connect the dots to understand how HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the DOM work together. Still not sure where they all live or where databases and other programming languages come in (Ruby) but at this point, I suspect that while HTML/CSS/JS are for creating visual experiences, Ruby is for organizing/tranferring data (from users or the IOT) in order to potetnially to use/expose it on the UI. 

In ognorance, I must proceed. LETS SKETCH!
