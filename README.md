# ETCH-A-SKETCH
ETCH-A-SKETCH project - The Odin Project - Foundations
I will eventually complete this project and it will be good enough to connect the dots to understand how HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the DOM work together. Still not sure whhere they all usually live or where databases and other programming languages come in (Ruby) but at this point, I suspect that hile wHTML/CSS/JS are for creating visual experiences, Ruby is for organizing/tranferring data in order to potetnially to used/exposed on the UI. 

LETS SKETCH!
